      <h2>üåå Solar System </h2>
      <p>
        The solar system is a collection of objects that revolve around a star called the Sun. It includes planets,
        moons, asteroids, and comets, among other things.

      <h2>‚òÄÔ∏è Sun</h2>

      <p>
        The Sun is a gigantic ball of hot gas and is at the center of our solar system. The Sun radiates this energy
        mainly as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, and is the most important source of energy for life on
        Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        About 4.5 billion years ago, the sun began to take shape from a molecular cloud that was mainly composed of
        hydrogen and helium. A nearby supernova emitted a shockwave, which came in contact with the molecular cloud and
        energized it.

      <h2>‚òÄÔ∏è Sun</h2>
      <p>
        The Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old yellow dwarf star a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium at the center of
        our solar system. It's about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth and it's our solar system's
        only star. Without the Sun's energy, life as we know it could not exist on our home planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        From our vantage point on Earth, the Sun may appear like an unchanging source of light and heat in the sky. But
        the Sun is a dynamic star, constantly changing and sending energy out into space. The science of studying the
        Sun and its influence throughout the solar system is called heliophysics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. Its diameter is about 865,000 miles (1.4 million kilometers).
        Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of
        debris in orbit around it.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="jupiterinfo" class="hidden" data-simplebar>
      <h2>ü™ê Jupiter</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more
        than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one
        one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen (90% by volume), followed by helium, which constitutes a quarter of
        its mass and a tenth of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the
        planet receives from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation rate of 1 rotation per 10 hours, the planet's shape
        is an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere, the largest contiguous
        structure in the Solar System after the heliosphere.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="mercuryinfo" class="hidden" data-simplebar>
      <h2>ü™ê Mercury</h2>
      <p>
        Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System. It is a terrestrial planet
        with a heavily cratered surface due to the planet having no geological activity and an extremely tenuous
        atmosphere (called an exosphere). Despite being the smallest planet in the Solar System with a mean diameter of
        4,880 km (3,030 mi), 38% of that of Earth's, Mercury is dense enough to have roughly the same surface gravity as
        Mars. Mercury has a dynamic magnetic field with a strength about 1% of that of Earth's and has no natural
        satellites.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to current theories, Mercury may have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid outer core,
        a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, Mercury has
        surface temperatures that change wildly during the day, ranging from 100 K (-173 ¬∞C; -280 ¬∞F) at night to 700 K
        (427 ¬∞C; 800 ¬∞F) during sunlight across the equator regions. At Mercury's poles though, there are large
        reservoirs of water ices that are never exposed to direct sunlight, which has an estimated mass of about
        0.025-0.25% the Antarctic ice sheet. There are many competing hypotheses about Mercury's origins and
        development, some of which incorporate collision with planetesimal and rock vaporization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because Mercury is very close to the Sun, the intensity of sunlight on its surface is between 4.59 and 10.61
        times the solar constant (amount of the Sun's energy received at 1 astronomical unit, which is roughly the
        distance between Earth and the Sun). Mercury orbits the Sun in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, meaning that relative
        to the background stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around
        the Sun.
      </p>

    <section id="venusinfo" class="hidden" data-simplebar>
      <h2>ü™ê Venus</h2>
      <p>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet with the densest atmosphere of all the rocky
        bodies in the Solar System, and the only one with a mass and size that is close to that of its orbital neighbour
        Earth. Orbiting inferiorly (inside of Earth's orbit), it appears in Earth's sky always close to the Sun, as
        either a "morning star" or an "evening star".
      </p>
      <p>
        While this is also true for Mercury, Venus appears much more prominently, since it is the third brightest object
        in Earth's sky after the Moon and the Sun, appearing brighter than any other star-like classical planet
        or any fixed star. With such a prominence in Earth's sky, Venus has historically been a common and important
        object for humans, in both their cultures and astronomy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Venus has a weak induced magnetosphere and an especially thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, which creates,
        together with its global sulfuric acid cloud cover, an extreme greenhouse effect. This results at the surface in
        a mean temperature of 737 K (464 ¬∞C; 867 ¬∞F) and a crushing pressure of 92 times that of Earth's at sea level,
        turning the air into a supercritical fluid, while at cloudy altitudes of 50 km (30 mi) pressure, temperature and
        also radiation is very much like at Earth's surface.
      </p>

    <section id="earthinfo" class="hidden" data-simplebar>
      <h2>üåé Earth</h2>
      <p>
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known where life developed and found
        habitability. This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid
        surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, spanning 70.8% of Earth's surface.
        The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land, most of which is located in the form of continential landmasses
        within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar
        deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water together. Earth's land
        is part of Earth's crust, consisting of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce
        mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Inside Earth's crust is a liquid outer core that generates the
        magnetosphere, deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids
        and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely present in
        the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and,
        together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the
        conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's
        light. This process maintains the current average surface temperature of 14.76 ¬∞C, at which water is liquid
        under atmospheric pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the
        Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes
        away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates
        around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is
        tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 384,400 km (1.28 light
        seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. Through tidal locking, the Moon always faces Earth with the
        same side, which causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
      </p>

    <section id="marsinfo" class="hidden" data-simplebar>
      <h2>ü™ê Mars</h2>
      <p>
        Mars is the fourth planet and the furthest terrestrial planet from the Sun. The reddish color of its surface is
        due to finely grained iron oxide dust in the soil, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet". Mars's
        radius is second smallest among the planets in the Solar System at 3,389.5 km (2,106 mi). The Martian dichotomy
        is visible on the surface: on average, the terrain on Mars's northern hemisphere is flatter and lower than its
        southern hemisphere. Mars has a thin atmosphere made primarily of carbon dioxide and two irregularly shaped
        natural satellites: Phobos and Deimos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Geologically, Mars is fairly active, with dust devils sweeping across the landscape and marsquakes (Martian
        analog to earthquakes) trembling underneath the ground. The surface of Mars hosts a large shield volcano
        (Olympus Mons) and one of the largest canyons in the Solar System (Valles Marineris).
      </p>
      <p>
        Mars's significant orbital eccentricity and axial tilt cause large seasonal changes to the polar ice caps'
        coverage and temperature swings between -110 ¬∞C (-166 ¬∞F) to 35 ¬∞C (95 ¬∞F) on the surface. A Martian solar day
        (sol) is equal to 24.5 hours and a Martian solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth years.
      </p>

    <section id="saturninfo" class="hidden" data-simplebar>
      <h2>ü™ê Saturn</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas
        giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average
        density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an
        intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale
        yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen
        layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but which has
        a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size.
      </p>
      <p>
        The planet has a prominent ring system, which is composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of
        rocky debris and dust. At least 146 moons are known to orbit the planet, of which 63 are officially named;
        this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="uranusinfo" class="hidden" data-simplebar>
      <h2>ü™ê Uranus</h2>
      <p>
        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is a gaseous cyan ice giant. Most of the planet is made out of
        water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is called 'ice' or volatiles.
        The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature of 49 K
        (-224 ¬∞C; -371 ¬∞F) out of all Solar System's planets. It has a marked axial tilt of 97.8¬∞ with a retrograde
        rotation rate of 17 hours. This means that in an 84 Earth years orbital period around the Sun, its poles get
        around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Uranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass among the Solar System's planets. Based on current
        models, inside its volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and surrounding it is a thick hydrogen and helium
        atmosphere. Trace amount of hydrocarbons (thought to be produced via hydrolysis) and carbon monoxide along with
        carbon dioxide (thought to have been originated from comets) have been detected in the upper atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, orbiting natural satellites and a magnetosphere. Its
        ring system is extremely dark, with only about 2% of the incoming light reflected, and contains the known 13
        inner moons.
      </p>

    <section id="neptuneinfo" class="hidden" data-simplebar>
      <h2>ü™ê Neptune</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known planet in the Solar System. It is the
        fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant
        planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser
        and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its
        atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet
        orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres;
        2.8 billion miles).
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium,
        along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, but contains a higher proportion of ices such as water,
        ammonia and methane. Similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock, both planets
        are normally considered "ice giants" to distinguish them. Along with Rayleigh scattering, traces of methane
        in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance.
      </p>

    <section id="plutoinfo" class="hidden" data-simplebar>
      <h2>ü™ê Pluto</h2>
      <p>
        Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the
        orbit of Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun. It is
        the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume, by a small margin, but is slightly less massive than Eris.
        Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner
        planets. Pluto has only one sixth the mass of Earth's moon, and one third its volume.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pluto has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit, ranging from 30 to 49 astronomical units (4.5 to 7.3
        billion kilometers; 2.8 to 4.6 billion miles) from the Sun. Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at
        its orbital distance of 39.5 AU (5.91 billion km; 3.67 billion mi). Pluto's eccentric orbit periodically brings
        it closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance prevents them from colliding.
      </p>
      <p>
        In August 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) downgraded the status of Pluto to that of ‚Äúdwarf
        planet.‚Äù This means that from now on only the rocky worlds of the inner Solar System and the gas giants of the
        outer system will be designated as planets.
